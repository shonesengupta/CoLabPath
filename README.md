# CoLabPath
 
### Citizen Science Collaboration & Career Path Recommendation Platform

---

## Overview

**CoLabPath** is a web-based platform that bridges **citizen science collaboration** with **data-driven career path recommendations**.  
The platform enables users to participate in real-world research projects while receiving personalized insights into potential career paths based on their skills, interests, and contributions.

CoLabPath reframes citizen science from being purely volunteer-driven into a **structured, career-oriented learning ecosystem** that converts participation into measurable professional value.

---

## Problem Statement

Despite the growth of citizen science platforms, most suffer from:

- Lack of structured skill validation  
- No clear career mapping for contributors  
- Difficulty translating participation into resume-ready experience  

At the same time, students and early professionals struggle to identify career paths that align with their real skills and interests.

**CoLabPath solves this by integrating collaboration, analytics, and intelligent recommendations into a unified system.**
